1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
  - setImmediate: to schedule the immediate execution of callback 
after I/O events callback and before setTimeout and setInterval
  - setTimeout() is to schedule execution of a one-time callback afer specific miliseconds

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
  - nextTick() is used to schedule a callback function to be invoked in the next iteration of the Event Loop.
  - setImmediate() method is used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes

3. Does Node.js has window object?
  - No, NodeJs just has global object (not window. window just has in browser)
